# Overview
The goal of this repository is to learn about gRPC and all of the surrounding components that might be in it.  Ideally there would be all sorts of clients for say Android, iOS, Web and even server setups.  The goal is to push all the information I know about gRPC and example integratons into this location.

# Structure
`grpc-node` contains a server that is setup and works with a bidirectional gRPC streaming client.  It also has a client in it as well to interact with the services.
`gprc-android` contains an Android project setup to hit the `grpc-node` chat service.
